# psa-grading-dashboard

My friend owns a sports cards business. Within his business, he submits cards for grading to PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator). Cards are graded on a scale from 1-10, based on its centering, corners, edges, and surface condition. Cards that grade higher are worth exponentially more, however, there is a fee to grade a card of ~$20 per card. Low grades can decrease the value of the card in addition to the fee. Therefore, it is important to be selective when deciding which cards to submit. I created this dashboard to help my friend use analytics to help guide his decision-making.
