# psa-grading-dashboard

## Motivation

My friend owns a sports cards business. Within his business, he submits cards for grading to PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator). Cards are graded on a scale from 1-10, depending on the quality on four main categories: centering, corners, edges, and surface condition. A higher numerical grade indicates a more prestine card. Thus, cards that receive higher grades are worth exponentially more than their raw (ungraded) value, however, cards that receive a low grade can decrease the value of the card. Additionally, there is a ~$20 fee to grade each card. Therefore, it is important to be selective when deciding which cards to submit. I created this dashboard to help my friend use analytics to help guide his decision-making.
